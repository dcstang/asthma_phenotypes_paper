# Determinants of asthma via machine learning 

This is the project code repository for the paper:  
`Phenotypes, determinants and risk factors of asthma in children versus adults: a machine learning approach`

Here we attach a code showcase of the algorithms used within the paper. All code was developed in R.

## Algorithms used
1. Elastic-net
2. Boruta feature selection with random forest
3. K-means imputation and k-prototype clustering
4. XgBoost
